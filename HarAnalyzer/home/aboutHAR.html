        <h1>Har files</h1>
        <p>HAR, short for HTTP Archive, is a format used for tracking information between a web browser and a website. 
            A HAR file is primarily used for identifying performance issues, such as bottlenecks and slow load times, 
            and page rendering problems. The HAR file keeps track of each resource loaded by the browser 
            along with timing information for each resource.
        </p>
        <h2>HAR file components</h2>
        <p>
            HAR file information is stored in JSON format which means in order to visualize 
            the information easier, tools such as the HAR Viewer can be used. Inside the HAR file, 
            there will be several timing components. Based on Google's Network Performance article, 
            the following outlines and explains each component that can exist in a HAR file generated 
            from Google Chrome's developer tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            Timing reads are displayed for each resource of a website when viewing them in Google Chrome's 
            Developer Tools - waterfall view. You can view this by going to Menu > More Tools > 
            Developer Tools and selecting the Network tab. You will need to refresh the page to see each 
            resource's details.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of these methods give a visual representation of how much time it is taking each resource 
            to load. With this information, we can analyze where there is potential to decrease page loading
             bottlenecks and increase site speed. Common things to look out for when analyzing a HAR file include
              the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            A HAR file contains a lot of valuable information for determining where you can improve website
             performance. With the ability to view HAR data directly from the browser or on a speed test 
             website, it is quite easy to access this information. Additionally, in the case that you need 
             to send a HAR file to someone for analysis, this can easily be done from within the browser 
             with the processes mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long DNS lookup times: DNS lookup times vary due to a number of factors. 
            However if you have many resources being loaded from third party websites, this can increase 
            the DNS lookup time for these resources thus decreasing the overall speed of your site. If this 
            is the case, consider moving some of these resources to your origin server or CDN if you prefer for 
            them to be cached.
